#ReactJS server
NodeJS application that builds ReactJS templates and routers to serve built applications on initial render 
and in browser.

## Installation
Clone this repository and make sure you have node and npm installed on your server.
Run `npm i` from root of project and it will install all dependencies.

## Running the applications
You can start the application by running `npm start`.

Once you start it, default application will be accessible at [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80) if nothing is 
using the port.

## Configuration
Out of the box, supported environments are `staging` and `production`. Additional config files can be added to 
`config/` directory. You can change the port number and number of CPU cores to use per environment in configuration files.

### Environments and configurations
`NODE_ENV` environment variable is parsed to determine the configuration file to be loaded. 

Development environment is the default one.

## Changelog
### Version 0.1.0
Initial server code.
